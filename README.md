# Babylon Editor

The goal of Babylon Editor is to create a powerful, easy-to-use editor for BabylonJS. The application will be implemented using Ember.js. To be clear, I created this projet to learn Ember 2, not for the editor itself. I've currently put development on hold for other private projects; however, thus far I have implemented a very cool resizable panel layout that allows dragging handles to resize adjacent panels. This is a key feature of the editor because it will facilitate organization of all panels including the camera viewports, scene outliner, content browser, etc.
